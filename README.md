# incomingTrainTelegramBot
This a fun and usless bot that i made to detect when an italian train is coming to a selected station


I made this specific bot for the streamer TheMark93 of the iTermosifoni
since the train are always honking and producing a jumpscare when passing by the station i made this bot to notify the user when the train is entering the station

#Attention
One last thing, since im really really lazy, i made this bot with a specific version of python-telegram-bot because i dont want to update my knowledge on how to use it
```pip install python-telegram-bot==13.13```


Byeeee
